      <h3>Even after 50 summers of providing meals to children, participation rates remain low relative to climbing National School Lunch Program enrollment. Here's why that matters.</h3>

      <p>Every day in Charlotte, North Carolina, an air-conditioned school activity bus full of free lunches turns into a church parking lot. Within minutes, 60 children cross the street from a mobile home park with their friends and neighbors to receive a meal.</p>

        <p>"It was just miraculous to see," said Tamara Baker, communications and project director for No Kid Hungry North Carolina, a nonprofit dedicated to helping children access nutrition programs. "The families just came up in droves. They spread out their own blankets underneath trees in the parking lot, and the kids immediately grabbed their food and went into the bus to eat it or sat down on a picnic blanket with their parents."</p>

          <p>"It was a beautiful day.""</p>

        <p>The church parking lot is one of more than 2,500 meal sites across North Carolina serving free meals to children as part of the national federally funded Summer Food Service Program. Last summer, the program distributed over 4,470,000 free meals in the state, funded with nearly $12.5 million from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</p>

      <p>But that only scratches the surface of what the program can do to address hunger in North Carolina--and the entire nation.</p>
      <p>The 50-year-old program has long-standing bipartisan support, yet participation remains low nationwide at only 12 percent of 22 million eligible students, according to the USDA.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="meals"></div>
    <div class="body-copy">
      <p>The program is an extension of the National School Lunch Program, continuing free meals from cafeterias during the school year to community spaces during the 10-week summer break.</p>

      <p>State agencies administer the program and recruit sponsors, such as school districts and private organizations, to prepare and distribute food to meal sites in areas where 50 percent of children qualify for free and reduced-priced lunch. Any child under 18 years old can receive a meal, no registration or identification required.</p>

      <p>Sponsors are reimbursed for each meal served with federal dollars. States typically recieve between a few hundred thousand dollars to up to $55 million annually.</p>

      <p>And there's more money--up to millions more a day for each state--up for grabs, but local hurdles and federal regulatory barriers keep communities from accessing it and leaving children with summertime food insecurity.</p>

      <p>"Logistics is the biggest barrier,"" said Maureen Berner, from the School of Government at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. "Not due to need, not due to willingness of people to meet the need."</p>

      <p>Without the summer meals program, students from low-income families lose access to often their only source of fresh, nutritious food until school starts again.</p>

      <p>"We hear a ton of stories of children who come into meal sites, and it's the only time they ever see fresh fruit or fresh vegetables all summer long," said McCamy Holloway, a summer nutrition consultant at the N.C. Department of Public Instruction. "It’s a costly food item in a lot of areas, especially because some of these sites are in food deserts.""</p>

      <p>Good, ongoing nutrition sets the foundation for a healthy diet that helps prevent chronic illnesses down the road, such as heart disease, diabetes, some types of cancer, and osteoporosis, according to the Food Research & Action Center.</p>

      <p>Nutrition and enrichment activities provided at meal sites also support mental wellness and brain development, which translates into success in the classroom, said Holloway.</p>

      <p>While most students slide back in academic achievement over the summer, low-income students fall back two months farther than their more affluent peers, according to a No Kid Hungry report. In the long run, these students are less likely to graduate high school and attend college.</p>

      <p>Reaching hundreds of thousands of children left out of the program could boost their physical, mental and academic well-being year-round as well as bring in spending to local economies.</p>
